# PyWaveFilters
`PyWaveFilters` is a small Python package to simulate wavefront filtering with pinholes and fibers.

## Features
Wavefront phase errors can be modeled in the following two ways:
* Using **Zernike polynomials** and
* using a K-correlation-based **power spectral density (PSD)** distribution.

To simulate the filtering of aberrated wavefronts two different optical elements can be used, namely
* **pinholes** and
* **single-mode fibers**.
