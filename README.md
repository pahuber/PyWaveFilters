# PyWaveFilters
`PyWaveFilters` is a small Python package to simulate wavefront filtering with pinholes and fibers.

## Features
Wavefront phase errors can be modeled in the following two ways:
* Using **Zernike polynomials**,
* Using a K-correlation-based **power spectral density (PSD)** distribution.

Two different optical elements can be used to simulate the filtering of aberrated wavefronts:
* **pinholes**,
* **single-mode fibers**.
